Working example of integrating Ionic 1.x side menus with [ezartech.com](http://ezartech.com)

Ezar implemention is based on [ezar-ionic](https://github.com/ezartech/ezar-ionic). Follow the instructions there to see how to install plugins.

A lot of workarounds, and a lot of work that needs to be done, but this is just a basic example of usage with Ionic 1.x and side menus.
